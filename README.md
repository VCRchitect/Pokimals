# Pok√©mon Animal Version

They said I was crazy for attempting, but here's my WIP ROM Hack to turn Crystal into a Roguelite!
So far I've finished:

1. Building the script for random "monsters" to appear in the ruins
2. Built the randomizer macro for the rooms
3. Made it so that, when you beat all the monsters, the doors open
4. When you beat the monsters, you also get two items to appear that choose from a random table of goodies
5. Replaced all 252 Pokemon, including art and 'Dex entries
6. Rewrote every song in the game with all original tunes
7. Made the script that sends you to a heal or mart hub to choose from after so many rooms beaten
8. Made the script that sends you to a pre-boss area after so many rooms beaten
9. Made the boss table for semi-random bosses to fight
10. Implemented the level cap for scaling gym fights

Things to Do:
1. Build all the Biomes for the Ruins
2. Build The Island
3. Build The Site
4. Make you pay a scaling amount to challenge gym leaders
5. Pick the starters for each type
